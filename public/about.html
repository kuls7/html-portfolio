<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>How I started and struggled:</h2>
<p>
  Hi my name is Kulsoom Midhat. I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science
  Engineering. I have since then, been trying to accomplish a full understanding
  of basic programming languages. Yes, I learned a bit in my bachelors, and no
  they do not teach you the basics or fundamentals. I never studied Computer
  Science before University so I barely caught up with what was being taught.
  <br />
  However, I didn't want to give up and especially when I found myself keen and
  excited about one course which I fortunately chose as an elective but ended up loving- Web Development. As much as I hated all
  other coding languages, I wanted to keep going just because of this slight
  spark I felt with this course.
</p>

<h2>More struggle:</h2>
<p>
  After I miraculously graduated with a magna cum laude, I tried doing
  self-teaching by tricking myself into thinking I could achieve better if I tutored. 
  So I invited all of my below average classmates over to my
  house and taught them the algorithms and data structures and a little bit of
  c++ and java here and there. Although it worked initially, as in I was able to
  grasp a lot of theories and concepts, I was not able to put efforts into
  building any projects myself. I lacked motivation and lost all the self
  esteem.
  <br />
  Few months later, I started tecahing as a professor at a Technical and
  Vocational College run by the Saudi Government. I did not teach a single thing
  about coding but rather the technical stuff like how to build a computer and
  how to update RAM. All the practical stuff with lab work. It wasn't exactly
  what I needed in my career but hey it was a start. I went on for about 2 years
  and mind you, I kept going farther and farther away from my goals. I kept
  getting rejected at other job interviews because of the zero knowledge and
  projects I had, and I wasn't even trying to find a solution. I took a break
  from work because I was getting married and moving countries. And this is
  where I found my energy back.
</p>
<h2> Ok but what did I do?</h2>
<p>
  I had all these random courses I bought on Udemy like 3 years ago and I had
  forgotten all about it. When I moved to America, I knew getting started here
  would be way tougher beause of culture shock and academic standards. I decided
  to enroll in a masters program but i knew it would be like history repeating
  itself with me not knowing any fundamentals and basics of programming.
  <br> So I built a road map of how to end up with a web developer's job:
  <ul>
    <li> Udemy courses
      <br/>
      <img src="../assets/images/funny2.PNG" width="300" alt="meme of brain reminding me to start udemy course"/>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Complete the FullStack Web Development course</li> 
      <li> What's Node? React? PostgreSQL? Web3? DApps? I have no idea!!! *brb crying*</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Build a portfolio</li>
    <li>Apply for internships (Optional)</li>
    <li>Basically build experience with actual practical knowledge</li>
    <li>Apply for beginner friendly jobs (Do they even offer those anymore? TT)</li>
    <li>Enroll for Master's Program</li>
  </ul>
  <br>And all that.... in like 3-4 months. Am I too being unrealistic or too hard on myself? We'll find out.
