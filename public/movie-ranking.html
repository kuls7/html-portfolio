  <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
  <p>
    It's a beautiful story of a dyslexic child finding true support and
    uncovering his potential. It's a tear- jerker because it shows the terrible
    indian standards for academic performance and the pain both parents and
    their child go through to survive.
  </p>
  <h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
  <p>
    A father and his young son are evicted from his apartment and live in a
    shelter, facing hardships, making sacrifices and srviving to make ends meet.
    I bawled my eyes out throughout the movie.

  <h3>Masaan</h3>
  <p>
    a heartbreaking love-story of a young man falling in love with a young girl
    from a different caste. The moral traditions, cruel punishments for not
    adhering to the traditions, the pain and sacrifice of people sincerely in
    love but not being able to do anything to acheive it- takes you on a
    rollercoaster of emotions, mainly giref.
